Hello, stranger!<br />
This is the first ever article on my blog, so here I'd like to explain who I am and what I do.<br/>
My name is Alex, born 23 years ago in a tiny russian village <i>Luzhki</i>, later moved to <i>Moscow</i>.
After getting a bachelor degree in computer sciences and applying for my first job at a large company
I got inspired for blogging my results, thoughts, advice and interesting things.<br/>
I already expect some questions, so let's start with the obvious one: <br/><br/>

<b>Why blog at all?</b><br/>
<br/>

The <i>first reason</i> is - sharing knowledge and giving mental pabulum to other people. All the time while googling all sorts of questions I stumble upon
pretty creative and innovational stuff in either traditional bloggers' dens or modern youtubers' channels.<br/>
They do motivate me to do all kinds of stuff: RC modeling, custom circuitry for home appliance, engineering research and development, music and much more!
As I keep on becoming further experienced in those fields, I really wish to also inspire people who come across this blog.<br/>
As more and more people say: <blockquote><i>Knowledge is power. Information is the most powerful weapon.</i></blockquote>
The <i>second reason</i>: blogging itself teaches you loads of skills. As I'm lacking skills in written English and making comprehensive structured articles,
blogging is the magic pill that comes into stage. Exploring mistakes from readers' feedback and reading other articles helps to perfect writing and value of my articles.<br/>
<br/>

<b>Who are you professionally?</b><br/><br/>

At this very moment of writing this article I earn a living sitting in a comfortable office chair and taking part in developing a large scale system
(for the purpose of confidentiality won't tell you this in detail).<br/>
My primary development language is Java, however, I also extensively study Scala, ML, previously worked as an embedded systems engineer
(x64 Assembler for life, you just can't forget that). By the way, this blog is entirely written from scratch using Spring (except for Disqus). Later I plan to make a post about the development process.<br/>
<br/>

<b>What's next?</b><br/><br/>
I hope this blog will not become the another abandoned god-knows-when existed website. I'll try posting whenever I'm able to.
Always open for your criticism and advice :)<br/>
