Camera drone basics, a (somewhat) comprehensive guide, from planning to professional career. Part 1: <br/>
<b>DANGER! IMAGES!</b><br/><br/>

About a year ago my acquaintance brought a micro quadcopter with him, just to fly for fun. Well, it was not fun.<br/>
This little flying machine just won't obey the commands I sent to it via a joystick. Move a stick a little more than you should, and BANG it flies into a nearest person/tree/wall (underline the appropriate) and charmingly crashes.
That day it just got destroyed by me, literally. Propellers torn, body cracked, motors not spinning. Ordered a replacement microquad for a friend and for me, just in case, 15$ for that truckload of fun spent at no question.<br/><br/>

Three weeks later it arrived. The shiny new <i>Cheerson CX-10</i>. It felt all the pain of a woman giving birth.
Within an hour it caught all objects and corners in its way.
If it were intelligent, this quad could make its way through my flat with eyes closed.<br/>
It has undergone 10 propeller replacements in a month. Finally, I <b>learned to fly</b> this evil creation of humankind. Strangely enough, it was sturdy enough not to become body-cracked.<br/><br/>
