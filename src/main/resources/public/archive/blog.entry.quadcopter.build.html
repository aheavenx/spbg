In part 1 I'm going to start out with a general hobby-explanatory article.<br/>
<b>DANGER! IMAGES!</b><br/><br/>

About a year ago my acquaintance brought a micro quadcopter with him, just to fly for fun. Well, it was not fun.<br/>
This little flying machine just won't obey the commands I sent to it via a joystick. Move a stick a little more than you should, and BANG it flies into a nearest person/tree/wall (underline the appropriate) and charmingly crashes.
That day it just got destroyed by me, literally. Propellers torn, body cracked, motors not spinning. Ordered a replacement microquad for a friend and for me, just in case, 15$ for that truckload of fun spent at no question.<br/><br/>

Three weeks later it arrived. The shiny new <i>Cheerson CX-10</i>. It felt all the pain of a woman giving birth.
Within an hour it caught all objects and corners in its way.
If it were intelligent, this quad could make its way through my flat with eyes closed.<br/>

Then I got a larger toy-grade drone, built a 210-sized racing quad, then a 450-sized drone, then took part in building a 850-sized X8 quad, took beautiful AP shots, and this is just a beginning...<br/><br/>

So this history leads to the first major point of entering the hobby:
<h3 style="color: #057f10"><b>Start small!</b></h3>
If you decide to straight out build a commercial expensive <span data-uk-tooltip title="Aerial photography" class="uk-text-primary">AP</span><span class="uk-text-small">?</span> platform, don't. Please. I have been reported of so many crashes due to pilot error.
Learning to steer a smaller drone will help you in extreme situations, where no barometer/triple GPS/A2 controller works, motor failed, and the only option is to manually land it.
Furthermore, piloting a smaller drone can help you decide if you DO want to take part in this hobby.<br/><br/>

Some of you would certainly ask me:
<h3><b>Why not buy an already ready-made Phantom/Inspire/3DR?</b></h3>
I'll list the pros and cons of such a purchase.<br/><br/>
<b>PROS:</b>
<ul>
    <li>It's ready-made <span data-uk-tooltip title="Federal Aviation Administration" class="uk-text-primary">FAA</span><span class="uk-text-small">?</span>/etc rules-compliant machine which most of the time does what you want it to</li>
    <li>User friendly: an example <i>DJI Mavic Pro</i> could be flown by a total beginner, simultaneously shooting good 4K footage</li>
    <li>Chinese copies of famous drones, they are cheaper and just about the same</li>
    <li>Some proprietary hardware is cheaper in all-in-one solutions (thermal imagers, agriculture watering, <span data-uk-tooltip title="Long range system (usually running at 433 MHz)" class="uk-text-primary">LRS</span><span class="uk-text-small">?</span>)</li>
</ul>
<b>CONS:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Crashing such a drone is a nightmare. Though being sturdy there birds still fall. And the repair costs quickly approach the cost of the drone itself!</li>
    <li>Prices. Custom-built solutions are cheaper, especially the professional ones</li>
    <li>You never know and learn what's inside. Try to get some black box logs</li>
    <li>Chinese copies of famous drones, they are cheaper and just about the same. Except for quality, it's a joke</li>
    <li>Little to none customizability. Can't put my own camera without those expensive adapters and stuff (hello again, DJI)</li>
    <li>For conspiracy theory adherents: <i><b>they</b> watch</i></li>
</ul>
<b>Still not convinced?</b> Here is a list of pros and cons of custom drone building:<br/><br/>
<b>PROS:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Practically unlimited possibilities to build and apply a drone (even a human-lifter could be built with enough experience)</li>
    <li>You will learn a lot. Electronics, soldering, circuitry, power, calculations, in theory and practice</li>
    <li>You know what's the drone is made of. Broken <span data-uk-tooltip title="Electronic Speed Control, orchestrates motor rotations" class="uk-text-primary">ESC</span><span class="uk-text-small">?</span>? Just replace with a similar. Enhance flight controller features? No problem!</li>
    <li>Highly customizable. Fire extinguishers, <span data-uk-tooltip title="Digital single-lens reflex camera, primarily used for video shooting" class="uk-text-primary">DSLRs</span><span class="uk-text-small">?</span>, <span data-uk-tooltip title="First Person View flights, using onboard mini camera" class="uk-text-primary">FPV</span><span class="uk-text-small">?</span>, all at your choice</li>
    <li>It's fun. Some people can't imagine how they lived without RCs</li>
    <li>For conspiracy theory adherents: only you know what your bird does</li>
</ul>
<b>CONS:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Research and time needed. The building process itself is not that slow-paced, but finding right components which will fit together is.</li>
    <li>Skills and equipment needed. Soldering skill is a must. Also you need a special charger for LiPo batteries, a remote controller, FPV screen. That initial purchase can be costly, but then it's being outweighed by pros.</li>
    <li>Steep learning curve. But it's the purpose of this very guide to simplify this process :)</li>
    <li>It's your own concern to provide safety for the others</li>
</ul>
<br/>
Regarding aerial photography, the most obvious reason to build a drone is to excel the commercial ones.
Good lifting capabilities, stability, safety, attached gimbals, double operator + cameraman operation, video streaming, all with YOUR own filming devices.
I've seen lots of commercial drones with such a purpose, but they cost like a skyscraper.
I could bet all I have that those are all made with the similar techniques, as described in next parts of this article.<br/>
If you already decided to build a drone by yourself, leave proposals/comments, and you're welcome to part 2, theory.
